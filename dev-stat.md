  <h2>Development Status</h2>
  <h4>March</h4>
  <p>21/3/23 - Behold the new development status. This is a fresh new status log. Still, everything is chicken bones, and a CSS and icon are yet to exist. However, these will be gotten to when I come around to it and have time. Probably not gonna happen until like 2 months later though.</p>
  <h4>April</h4>
  <p>9/4/23 - Once again I have forgotten about this... But, we have plenty of new things floating around, like a CSS!</p>
  <p>19/3/23 - Added the footer, finally understanding copyright laws around published works :D. Edward added Latex for me, and I (hopefully) now have an icon!</p>
  <h4>May</h4>
  <p>4/5/23 - I don't have any major improvements, however Term 2 has kickstarted with lots of assessments, and some new notes on <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes.html">the notes page!</a><br>I intend on writing more stuff (since I haven't been writing for a little while) and producing some more useful content.<br>Also, pressing on the logo will also take you back to the home page.</p>
