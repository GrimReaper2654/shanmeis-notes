  <h4>T1W4L2 - 21/2</h4>
  <p>- Started learning about the power equation.<br>- Did stile for most of the class, and we revised graphing skills. I'm so glad I revised chem over the hols otherwise I would have forgotten about the line of best fit.<br>- Hw - finish the graph</p>
  <h4>T1W4L3 - 23/2</h4>
  <p>- Did waves, learnt a lot of new things.<br>- Working on Intro To Waves in Stile.<br>- Had lots of issues with Wifi, wasn't able to connect the whole lesson :(</p>
  <h4>T1W5L1 - 27/2</h4>
  <p>- Started with light waves theory.<br>- Finished the stile.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L2 - 28/2</h4>
  <p>- Finished the Stile. Waves quiz and Refraction.<br>- Math test next period and my friend and I are freaking out.<br>- We got Ms Burnett. :(( and she doesn't like that fact that some of us are not doing science.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L3 - 2/3</h4>
  <p>- We worked on Sound 1 in Stile<br>- Unfortunately I was late because there was an accident in Cockburn and our relief teacher was Ms Enslin... and she didn't give my friend and I the easiest time explaining why the kiosk doesn't print out a note.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L1 - 7/3</h4>
  <p>- Worked on Stile, Sound 2<br>- Mr Mort came back!</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 9/3</h4>
  <p>- We did a light practical for the period, my friend and I made some rainbows with light and prisms. Very fun. The main focus was angles of incidence and reflection.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L3 - 10/3</h4>
  <p>- Did the science inquiry practice test. Don't think I'll manage to finish the real test in time unfortunately. Gotta write faster.

  <h4>T1W7L1 - 13/3</h4>
  <p>- Went through the science cat. The notes on it can be found<a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes/year-9/science/t1-cat-task.html"> here</a>. Please do not copy off my notes if you are in my year group :')</p>
  <h4>T1W7L2 - 14/3</h4>
  <p>- Continued with the CAT task.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L3 - 16/3</h4>
  <p>- Got questions answered about Cat Validation and started with Sound Experiment Stile.<br>- I still think this whole science cat is so stupid like we legit got three dependant variables...</p>
  <h4>T1W8L1 - 20/3</h4>
  <p>- Continued with editing the cat task.</p>
