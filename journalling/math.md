  <h2>Math Journal</h2>
  <h3>Term 2</h3>
  <h4>T2W1L1 - 24/4</h4>
  <p>- Continued with solving linear equations. Doing the next Mathspace "taks"</p>
  <h4>T2W1L3 - 26/4</h4>
  <p>- Doing the elimination method of simultaneous equations. Boy I'm starting to hate simultaneous equations.<br>- Doing T2W1 Task 2 on Mathspace</p>
  <h4>T2W1L4 - 27/4</h4>
  <p>- We went through word problems. Then we worked on the math investigation</p>
  <h4>T2W2L1 - 1/5</h4>
  <p>- We did some practice for word problems. Learnt direct proportion.<br>- Direct proportion is the Mathspace task to do.<br>- Ms Liu has changed the due date of investigation for my class to I don't know what (didn't quite understand her, I will get it clarified). I'm not sure about other classes.</p>
  <h4>T2W2L2 - 2/5</h4>
  <p>- Learnt inverse proportion. Then doing mathspace, and if time, investigation.<br>- I have had the investigation details cleared up. The <b>code</b> is due on <b>Friday night</b>. The <b>powerpoint</b> needs to be submitted by <b>Sunday night</b>. Code is to be submitted via <b><a href="https://codequiry.com/">https://codequiry.com/</a></b> and powerpoint is to be submitted through <b>Connect submission</b>.</p>
  <h4>T2W2L3 - 3/5</h4>
  <p>- We got a whole session to do our coding. However, I used the session to finish my mathspace<br>- Investigation submission method got changed again, we now submit both on Connect</p>
  <h4>T2W2L4 - 4/5</h4>
  <p>- We got yet another lesson to do coding, still finishing mathspace<br>- Our method of submitting got changed YET AGAIN. We now have to submit code onto Grok and a Form, submit the powerpoint via a Form and a special word doc. We also have to fill in Forms on how we coded the project and why we thing Coding is important for us...</p>






  <h3>Term 1</h3>
  <h4>T1W4L2 - 21/2</h4>
  <p>- Learning about financial math - econs lesson??<br>- I was searching up some of the vocab Ms Liu was using so I wasn't concentrating, then I got picked on :'( I'm glad it was an easy question and that it was straightforward<br>- Turns out theres this thing on Mathspace that gives you stars instead of grading your questions<br>- Working on 7.03 and 7.04 on Mathspace<br>- Was just announced that the Term 1 test is next week Monday. Time to enslave myself to my grades once again.</p>
  <h4>T1W4L3 - 22/2</h4>
  <p>- Doing compound interest now. I uh don't really get how it works but I know how to do it. But it's ok.<br>- I am so worried that in the test, there will be solving for example the squ root of 5. Test says no calculator...<br>- Test also got postponed to Tuesday, which means I have an extra day a period to study. Will start studying today.<br>- Doing 5.01 mathspace. Can't believe I read the 2nd question wrong 3 times.<br>- Teacher called me WanG Shan-Mei (ToT)</p>
  <h4>T1W4L4 - 23/2</h4>
  <p>- Test revision today. Today was the first time Ms Liu actually checked our homework. I glad I did it.<br>- Didn't know Mathspace was capable of using vocab such as "depreciate"</p>
  <h4>T1W5L1 - 27/2</h4>
  <p>- Another period of test revision.<br>- Learnt some new expanding formulas to aid us in the test.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L2 - 28/2</h4>
  <p>- We had the test today.<br>- Goodbye 100%. I know I didn't ace the test already.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L3 - 1/3</h4>
  <p>- Breaking news - we now have an awesome teacher. It's been one day and we have our tests back already!! Unfortunately, I didn't do very well on it.<br>- We started adding and dividing and algebraic fractions, doing 1.01 on Mathspace.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L4 - 2/3</h4>
  <p>- We did 1.02 in math and learnt how to divide and multiply algebraic fractions.<br>- We also continued with our coding journey on Grok<br>- Ms Liu wore some very flowery dress with a very flowery hat which was very very stylish</p>
  <h4>T1W6L1 - 7/3</h4>
  <p>- Did distributive law.<br>- Mathspace 2.02 and 2.03 for hw.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 8/3</h4>
  <p>- Basically just practised.<br>- Ms Liu assigned us 2.03 twice .0.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L3 - 9/3</h4>
  <p>- We learnt a little on factorising, and worked on 2.06 mathspace<br>- Also did coding for the last 30 minutes.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L1 - 13/3</h4>
  <p>- Practised expanding and factorising. Did a little bit of extention work. Half the class is desperately studying for their languages tests, it's really quite funny to see all the screens on EP.<br>- Got picked on. Argh. There are some people that are still yet to be picked on. Hmph.<br>- Did textbook questions.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L2 - 14/3</h4>
  <p>- Learnt about specific factoring techniques. Got picked on again but it was alright.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L3 - 15/3</h4>
  <p>- Started with factoring trinomial monic equations.<br>- Did practice on Mathspace.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L1 - 21/3</h4>
  <p>- We went through completing expanded equations and learnt an extention to factoring perfect squares.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L2 - 22/3</h4>
  <p>- Got a relief, we did Mathspace.</p>
  <h4>T1W8L3 - 23/3</h4>
  <p>- Did some practice questions and looked at simplifying fractions.<br>- This is the first time ever I have a good grasp on algebra and not falling behind :D<br>- Doing 1.11 Mathspace in class, 1.10 for homework.</p>
  <h4>T1W9L1 - 27/3</h4>
  <p>- Literally just revised algebra - finding the unknown value</p>
  <h4>T1W9L2 - 29/3</h4>
  <p>- Doing 3.1 and 3.2 on Mathspace<br>- Ms Liu's not here so we got Burnett instead :/<br>- I need to finish 3.01</p>
  <h4>T1W10L2 - 4/4</h4>
  <p>- Did more stuff on linear equations as added to last year, and put the equations into scenarios.<br>- Doing 3.05 mathspace</p>
  <h4>T1W10L3 - 5/4</h4>
  <p>- Learnt about formulas and subjects in formulas. We also revised and expanded on solving equations. Doing "Week 10 Formulas" mathspace<br>- Gosh I just looked at my mathspace and I have lots to finish :'(</p>
