  <h4>T1W5L4 - 2/3</h4>
  <p>- Cont of source analysis. Ms Pyper is yet again not here... we have Ms Murphy (relief, not music).<br>- Finishing all four of the source analysis. Well they were meant to be finished, I finished 2 of the four</p>
  <h4>T1W6L1 - 7/3</h4>
  <p>- We had the Hass test today. Screw the perspective question. It was so harrrrrrd :((. Somehow I wrote about economical change in the evaluate question. And there were no questions about Yolngu Bark Petitions... oh well.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L2 - 8/3</h4>
  <p>- Started topic 4 in HaSS. First task is to create a flow chart of sorts on what the events to the lead-up to the Tent Embassy.</p>
  <h4>T1W6L3 - 9/3</h4>

  <h4>T1W7L2 - 14/3</h4>
  <p>- Continued with 4.2. When Ms Pyper went around checking what everyone had done, my TEAMS OPENED SOMEHOW AND SHE THOUGHT I WAS TEXTING EVEN THOUGH I HADN'T OPENED TEAMS SINCE THAT MORNING. I was so frustrated arghhh.<br>- I also seriously thought I had aquatic rec that period (because Ms Gunzberg said we had it 5th period and I thought she got the periods wrong) so I was like 5 minutes late.</p>
