  <p>- Learnt new kanji and vocab, and grammar points. We are on the topic of body parts and describing the physical appearance of people.<br>- We still don't have those booklets that we were meant to get. I hope I get them soon so i can catch up on materal.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L1 - 27/2</h4>
  <p>- Learnt more words and grammar again today. I really want my 3rd period of languages back. Now every lesson is learning a new set of words and we have no way to consolidate our knowledge while in class.<br>- We found out the assessment is 2 Fridays later, and we found that we ALSO haven't learnt all of the material required for the assessment... so my class and myself are pretty screwed.</p>
  <h4>T1W7L1 - 13/3</h4>
  <p>- I had the test today. It was very stressful. My heart was beating like crazy because I had just played two intense games of touch rugby the period before and I was trying to fan myself down and couldn't concentrate properly during the listening section.<br>- Yes I know I said it was gonna be on Friday but Karasavas Sensei emailed us last week and told us that it was gonna be today.</p>
