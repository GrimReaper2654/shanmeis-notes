      Journalling Info
  </h3>
  <p>This is here mainly for the purpose of providing what I did in lessons, to help friends catch up when they're sick or away :'D</p>
  <p>I saw someone (I'm not naming) do this as well, and thought it would be helpful, and I felt sad that no one did this as well in my year.</p>
