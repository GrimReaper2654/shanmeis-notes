  <h2>How Year 9 Skirt Length Correspond to an Invisible Hierarchy</h2>
  <p>Disclaimer: Please don't take this seriously. This is just a joke. If you believe you are cool, then I support you fully. Everyone can and is cool. If you believe you are higher up or lower down the hierarchy, then it be so.</p>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>Basically, the shorter the skirt, the cooler and higher up the girls hierarchy you are. This includes if your skirt is normally this short or if you have rolled it up. If you identify as a girl but don't own a school skirt or a dress, then you are placed around the middle-lower end of the hierarchy. If you usually don't wear one but sometimes do, count to as how long your skirt is when you do wear it. Dresses kind of count but don't have such a huge impact. I will not name anyone except my own friend group.</p>
  <h4>The girls with the shortest skirts</h4>
  <p>Literally the queens of the year group. They're the coolest and ranked the highest on this hierarchy. These girls are towards the pretty end, and they're generally quite sassy. They get along with people decently well and "everyone" likes them. Their skirt lengths show the majority of their legs, and theyre generally hemmed then rolled up further. They generally pick dance or visual art for their art subject. Many of them have guys chasing after them or already have a boyfriend. These girls are way off who I interact with. They're just too cool for me yknow.</p>
  <h4>Just a little below the highest ranking</h4>
  <p>This group of girls have skirt lengths that are like mid-thigh but aren't excruciatingly short like the group above them. They are still extremely popular girls and many people still like them.</p>
  <h4>Mid range</h4>
  <p>These are the girls whose skirts just pass the school rules. 10cm above knee. Maybe a little higher, maybe a little lower. We'll never know. These is when people genuinely aren't used to walking in long skirts. They might be rolled up, they might not. These people are generally nice and are quite peaceful. Some of these are music kids. Some are drama and dance kids. Some are VA kids. We'll never know. Generally, this is the most mysterious and unique group of girls.</p>
  <h4>Below 10cm and knee length</h4>
  <p>These people are nerdy people. Like Ellie. The sweats of the year. These are very smart people, however aren't very popular at all. We should fear these people. These are the 99 Atar club girls. Most of these are music kids.</p>
  <h4>Below knee length</h4>
  <p>The people with the longest skirts - I'm pretty sure Luvenia, Crystal, Arielle and my skirts are the longest. We actually look like nuns. Skirts are below knee quite far down. We're the people that don't exactly care how we look. We don't really socialise with the rest of our cohort, except we socialise with our hobbies and studies. Some of us are gaming addicted (not me). Some of us are study addicted (like me). Most of us don't get enough sleep.</p>
  <h4>Skirtless ones</h4>
  <p>They're places around the middle and lower ends of the spectrum. They're generally fairly outgoing people but they don't have the loud qualities of the top of spectrum but
