  <h1>Shan-Mei's Notes</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Shan-Mei, a high school year 9 student from Perth, Australia.</p>
  <p>The purpose of these notes is to:<br>1. Help classmates and the junior years in catching up with work when they don't pay attention :)<br>2. Publicise my music theory courses and provide the free extra theory and lit content to anyone who doesn't want to pay for a course.<br>3. "Make education free and accessible" - Edward (don't you worry, I follow the same principle)</p>
  <p>They can be found <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>I no longer know how frequently this will be updated. <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/journalling.html">Journalling</a> will be updated almost every day, notes will be updated when I have the time.</p>
  <p>These notes hopefully cover a large range of subjects, from your common core subjects to music theory to notes from sermons (Christianity based things) to tips with studying, cramming and managing stress.</p>
  <p>I live in the <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting/the-town.html">town</a>.</p>
  <p>I also write about other things <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Development Status</h3>
  <p>Behold the new development status. This is a fresh new status log. Still, everything is chicken bones, and a CSS and icon are yet to exist. However, these will be gotten to when I come around to it and have time. Probably not gonna happen until like 2 months later though.<br>View full status <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/dev-stat.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>
    I have a couple friends that first introduced and inspired me to make this :) Thanks to them, this thing exists. Some of you may know my friend Beatrice, she also has a note page on Wix. Her website will be linked below. Her note page was the first note page I was shown, and going over her website made me want to do it on Wix, but unfortunately the 100 pages limit made me swap to Github. The second notes page I was shared was by my friend Edward. His notes are on Github and I'll also be linking his notes page :)
