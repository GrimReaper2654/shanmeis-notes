  <h1>Shan-Mei's Notes</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/about-me.html">Shan-Mei</a>, a high school year 9 student from Australia.</p>
  <p>The purpose of these notes is to:<br>1. Help classmates and the junior years in catching up with work when they don't pay attention :)<br>2. Publicise my music theory courses and provide the free extra theory and lit content to anyone who doesn't want to pay for a course.<br>3. "Make education free and accessible" - Edward (don't you worry, I follow the same principle)</p>
  <p>Here are my <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes.html">notes.</a> These notes will hopefully cover a range of subjects, from our cores to extracurriculars like music.</p>
  <p>I also like to keep a <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/journalling.html">journal</a> of my day's happenings and I also like to aimlessly <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting.html">rant</a> about things. I also like it when my peers and teacher say <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting/quotes.html">funny things.</a></p>
  <p>I am affiliated with the lovely <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting/the-town.html">OOM Town.</a>

  <h3>Development Status</h3>
  <p>29/5/23 - Completely overhauled some sections, added some more notes. I am slowly moving away from html and edging towards markdown for my newer pages. I changed the index page (as you can see). Thinking of doing some more user interactive stuff (music stuff, since I can't do any other arts). Also thinking of adding an email subscribe list so I can notify people when I send out notes. I feel my website has reached the point where there will be not much new stuff design wise - the website is moving along a steady pace of becoming bigger.<br>View full status <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/dev-stat.html">here.</a></p>
