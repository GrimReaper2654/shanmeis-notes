###### Essay
In modern day, Myanmar is moving towards a liberal democracy system. In a liberal democracy, legitimacy can be defined as when a government has the appropriate authority to rule. This usually includes having a high degree of popular support. Freedom is where people are allowed to make decisions, accept responsibility and choose between alternatives as long as it is within the constitution. The definition of power is where power is limited and defined by the constitution, and it is split between 3 arms of government - legislative, executive and judiciary. The four frameworks of a liberal democracy include legitimacy, justice, freedom and power. Myanmar upholds its four frameworks to a limited extent, as legitimacy, freedom and power are undermined through the 2021 coup, the genocide of the Rohingya minority and undermining of the Rule of Law in Myanmar.

The legitimacy framework is undermined through the 2021 coup in Myanmar. A coup is defined as a military take-over, and in 2021, Myanmar's government was taken over by the military. In 2020, Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party won the elections by a landslide, and the military respected the results. However, there was a coup, lead by Min Aung Hlaing. This severely undermines legitimacy and political systems, as legitimacy is when a government has the appropriate authority and mandate to rule. Min Aung Hlaing replaced the current leader, Aung San Suu Kyi and he was unelected. Therefore, the undermining of the legitimacy framework proves that the four frameworks are upheld to a limited extent currently today.

The freedom framework is undermined through the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people. A genocide is an orchestrated mass killing of a specific religious group or race. Ethnic cleansing is defined as the removal of an ethnicity from a place.  Myanmar is a primarily Buddhist country, and the Rohingya people are primarily Muslim. The military first introduced the genocide in 2016. There have also been many restrictions placed on the Rohingya, such as restrictions on basic rights. This undermines the freedom framework - the freedom framework includes freedom of religious beliefs. Rohingya people have many restrictions on marriage, especially where Rohingya people have to go through the government to be married. The marriage procedures also contain ceremonies that go against their Muslim religion. Therefore, the liberal frameworks are upheld to a limited extent, as shows in the undermining of the Freedom framework.

The power framework is undermined through the overriding of the rule of law by the government and military. The Rule of Law is An example of this is shown by the 2021 coup, where all legislative, executive and judiciary powers are transferred to the military. In 2021, the military declared that the 2020 landslide was a fraud, and there was a coup that overtook the current government. This is an undermining of the power framework as the constitution recognises the rule of law and it also splits the three arms of government. Therefore, the liberal frameworks are upheld to a limited extent through the undermining of the power framework in Myanmar.

Myanmar upholds its 4 frameworks to a limited extent after 2021. It is shown by the undermining of the legitimacy, freedom and power frameworks through the 2021 coup, the genocide of the Rohingya people and the undermining of the Rule of Law in Myanmar. The points show that the 2021 coup, lead by Min Aung Hlaing, severely fractured the upholding of the four frameworks.
