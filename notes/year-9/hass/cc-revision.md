## Civics and Citizenship Revision
### Constitutionalism and the framework of politics and law in Australia 
#### Separation of Power
The separation of power is the idea that the legislative, executive and judiciary powers should be split to avoid corruption.  
Legislative branch
- Consists of the Governer General, House of Representatives and Senate
- Role is to make laws
Executive branch
- The King, Prime Minister and other ministers
- Role is to put laws into action
Judiciary branch
- Consists of the High Court of Australia and other federal courts
- Role is to interpret the constitution and make decisions
#### Federalism
Federalism is the idea that the Government should be divided into a central (federal) government and other smaller governments (state and local)  
For it to work, the governments have different powers, but the federal government always overrides the state, and the state over the local.  
- Federal: Security, defence, immmigration, environment
- State: Roads, prisons, housing, public transport, police and ambulance service
- Local: Town planning, rubbish collection, water and sewage, dog registration, local roads
#### Constitution
A constitution is the fundamental laws of a nation or organisation. It sets out how it should be organised and operated.  
The Australian Constitution ensures that the Constitution is difficult to change and that corruption is minimised.  
- To change the constitution, some certain steps have to be followed. They are as follows
  1. A member of either house writes a Bill. The title of the Bill is read out to the corresponding house by the Clerk.
  2. The minister in charge of the Bill will read it out for a second time to the house, and this time members are allowed to debate the Bill and make speeches about it.
  3. The house can make amendments to the Bill
  4. Bill is read a third time to the house and sometimes can be debated again
  5. 1 - 4 is repeated in the other house
  6. A referendum is held in Australia. A double majority is required for the Bill to pass.
  7. The Bill is given to the Governer General for royal assent, and if assent is given, the Bill becomes a Law.
#### Representative Democracy
Representative democracy is where citizens elect a member to act on their behalf  
- Comprises of the House of Representatives and the Senate
  - Senate is the upper house. There are 12 representatives per state and 2 representatives per territory. They keep the lower house in check and they also assist debate topics from the lower house. There are 72 senators.
  - The House of Representatives is the lower house. They are also considered the people's house, as they are elected by the people of separate, even electorates. There are 151 house of reps.
### The High Court
#### Roles and Powers
The high court was formed in 1903.  
The roles of the high court is to hear to civil and criminal matter and other matters  
- Determining appeals
- Interpreting the Constitution
- Other areas (like state v state, state v commonwealth)
#### Appellate and Original Jurisdiction
The high court hears appeals from lower courts (mainly supreme court)  
Original Jurisdiction is where matters are heard for the first time.  
- Generally this happens in lower courts, then is appealed higher and higher
#### Court Hierarchy of WA
Made of different courts  
They are ranked by the seriousness of matters they hear to - the higher the court, the more serious the matter  
- Magistrates court -> District court -> Supreme Court of Western Australia -> High Court of Australia.  
- They all attend to civil and criminal matters, but only the High Court of Australia deals with things outside of this.  
#### Dual Citizenship
The dual citizenship case is when 7 members of parliament were suspected to be dual citizens.  
  - Members include:  
  - Larissa Waters (Greens Senator)
  - Scott Ludlam (Greens Senator) 
  - Matt Canavan (Nationals Senator) 
  - Malcolm Roberts (One Nation Senator) 
  - Barnaby Joyce (Nationals Member of the House of Representatives and Deputy Prime Minister)
  - Fiona Nash (Nationals Senator)
  - Nick Xenophon (Nick Xenophon Team Senator) 
- Waters and Ludlam resigned after the media coverage broke out
- Other 5 went to the High Court for its decision making
- Canavan and Xenophon were found to not be dual citizens
- The other three had to give up their dual citizenship and win back their seat by announcing that they were no longer dual citizens.
- This shows the power of the high court and that no one is above the law - the Government was hoping that the High Court would allow Joyce especially to continue with a dual citizenship but the High Court simply followed the constitution.
#### Love and Thoms v Commonwealth - Landmark Case
The issue  
- They wanted to change section 51 of the constitution so Aboriginal people could not be classified as aliens.
- Both Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms had their visas cancelled due to criminal matters.
When and who  
- Love and Thoms were men of Indigenous tribes
- They were facing deportation until section 501 of the migration act
- The decision was handed down in 11th of Feb 2020
Outcome  
- The high court decided that Love and Thoms were not aliens, and therefore cannot be deported.
Decision  
- Has specific implications on how the Government can treat Indigenous Australians who have been born overseas and have dual citizenship
- It demonstrates the power of the high court and their role in interpreting the constitution and decision making.
### Frameworks of a Liberal Democracy
#### Liberal Democracy
A liberal democracy is a democracy organised in such a way to define and limit powers and promote a legitimate government. There are four frameworks - legitimacy, freedom, justice and power.  
#### Legitimacy
A legitimate government is a government with the appropriate authority to rule. This usually means having popular support.  
To uphold legitimacy in a representative democracy, there must be:  
- Equal vote
- Free vote
- Independent oversight
  - Overseen by the Australian Electoral Commission. They are not influenced by the Government or other parties.
    - They organise elections and referendums
    - They manage the electoral roll, boundaries and registration of political parties
    - They must follow the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918
- Right to stand for office
- Predictable pattern of elections
- Frequent elections
  - House of representative elections are every 3 years
  - Senators are every 6, with split elections of half the senators every 3 years.
  - In WA, Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council are elected every 4 years on the 2nd Saturday of March.
In the house of representatives, each representative is elected through preferential voting. Each member needs more than 50% of the votes to win.  
- Electorates of around 100k people
- 151 electorates, and these electorates are adjusted as populations numbers increase/decline
In the senate, representatives are elected through proportional voting. There are 12 senators a state and 2 per territory.  
Voters vote through a secret ballot, where voters' votes remain completely anonymous. This means there should be no fear in voting.  
Enrolling to vote and voting is compulsory in Australia. To vote, you must be over 18 years old and be an Australian citizen.  
People also have the right to stand for office as well as vote. To stand for office, you must:  
- Be 18+ years old
- Be on the electoral roll
#### Freedom
Freedom is where citizens can:
- Make decisions
- Learn
- Accept responsibility
- Capacity to choose alternatives
- Do anything within law
- Have political and civil liberties
  - Freedom in religion, etc
#### Justice
Justice is where all citizens are treated equally, and with dignity and respect.  
- Can be seen when merits and hard work are rewarded, rather than social status
- Also applies in terms of questioning
  - Everyone is treated equally
  - Innocent before proven guilty
#### Power
Power is limited and defined by the constitution. The power is also split between three arms of government: legislative, executive and judiciary.  
#### Upholding of frameworks
Legitimacy:  
- Frequent elections -> makes sure that people are always happy with the government
- Equal vote -> everyone gets equal say so there is no bias in the government
Freedom:  
- Freedom of speech -> people can protest peacefully
- Freedom of religion -> Churches can choose to wed certain couples
Justice:  
- No one is above the law -> Former PM Malcom turnbull was fined $300 for failing to wear a life jacket
- Respect for all citizens -> Racism and other kinds of bias are not tolerated
Power:  
- Splitting of power -> limiting and defining power - 3 arms of government
- Opposition -> limiting corruption
#### Threats to frameworks
Legitimacy:  
- Unequal voting
- Not everyone voting
- Incompetence of AEC
Freedom:  
- Barring of protests
Justice:  
- Social influence on courts
- Bias/favouritism
- Poor legal representation
Power:  
- Corruption
- Incompetence of one of the government arms.
