## Civics and Citizenship Revision
#### The High Court of Australia
This court is the highest court of appeal in Australia. It is also holds an important role in upholding the Constitution.  

Court hierarchy:  
- Made of different courts  
- They are ranked by the seriousness of matters they hear to - the higher the court, the more serious the matter  
    - Magistrates court -> District court -> Supreme Court of Western Australia -> High Court of Australia.  
    - They all attend to civil and criminal matters, but only the High Court of Australia deals with things outside of this.  
- Cases in lower courts can appeal to be heard in a higher court  
- The decisions of a higher court form **precendent** over lower courts

- Deals with:  
    - Determining appeals (from any state)  
    - Interpreting constitution

#### Separation of Power
The separation of power is the idea that the legislative, executive and judiciary powers should be split to avoid corruption.  
Legislative branch
- Consists of the Governer General, House of Representatives and Senate
- Role is to make laws
Executive branch
- The King, Prime Minister and other ministers
- Role is to put laws into action
Judiciary branch
- Consists of the High Court of Australia and other federal courts
- Role is to interpret the constitution and make decisions
#### Federalism
Federalism is the idea that the Government should be divided into a central (federal) government and other smaller governments (state and local)  
For it to work, the governments have different powers, but the federal government always overrides the state, and the state over the local.  
- Federal: Security, defence, immmigration, environment
- State: Roads, prisons, housing, public transport, police and ambulance service
- Local: Town planning, rubbish collection, water and sewage, dog registration, local roads
#### Constitution
A constitution is the fundamental laws of a nation or organisation. It sets out how it should be organised and operated.  
The Australian Constitution ensures that the Constitution is difficult to change and that corruption is minimised.  
- To change the constitution, some certain steps have to be followed. They are as follows
  1. A member of either house writes a Bill. The title of the Bill is read out to the corresponding house by the Clerk.
  2. The minister in charge of the Bill will read it out for a second time to the house, and this time members are allowed to debate the Bill and make speeches about it.
  3. The house can make amendments to the Bill
  4. Bill is read a third time to the house and sometimes can be debated again
  5. 1 - 4 is repeated in the other house
  6. A referendum is held in Australia. A double majority is required for the Bill to pass.
  7. The Bill is given to the Governer General for royal assent, and if assent is given, the Bill becomes a Law.
