## Civics and Citizenship Revision
### Constitutionalism and the framework of politics and law in Australia 
#### Separation of Power
The separation of power is the idea that the legislative, executive and judiciary powers should be split to avoid corruption.  
Legislative branch
- Consists of the Governer General, House of Representatives and Senate
- Role is to make laws
Executive branch
- The King, Prime Minister and other ministers
- Role is to put laws into action
Judiciary branch
- Consists of the High Court of Australia and other federal courts
- Role is to interpret the constitution and make decisions
#### Federalism
Federalism is the idea that the Government should be divided into a central (federal) government and other smaller governments (state and local)  
For it to work, the governments have different powers, but the federal government always overrides the state, and the state over the local.  
- Federal: Security, defence, immmigration, environment
- State: Roads, prisons, housing, public transport, police and ambulance service
- Local: Town planning, rubbish collection, water and sewage, dog registration, local roads
#### Constitution
A constitution is the fundamental laws of a nation or organisation. It sets out how it should be organised and operated.  
The Australian Constitution ensures that the Constitution is difficult to change and that corruption is minimised.  
- To change the constitution, some certain steps have to be followed. They are as follows
  1. A member of either house writes a Bill. The title of the Bill is read out to the corresponding house by the Clerk.
  2. The minister in charge of the Bill will read it out for a second time to the house, and this time members are allowed to debate the Bill and make speeches about it.
  3. The house can make amendments to the Bill
  4. Bill is read a third time to the house and sometimes can be debated again
  5. 1 - 4 is repeated in the other house
  6. A referendum is held in Australia. A double majority is required for the Bill to pass.
  7. The Bill is given to the Governer General for royal assent, and if assent is given, the Bill becomes a Law.
#### Representative Democracy
Representative democracy is where citizens elect a member to act on their behalf  
- Comprises of the House of Representatives and the Senate
  - Senate is the upper house. There are 12 representatives per state and 2 representatives per territory. They keep the lower house in check and they also assist debate topics from the lower house. There are 72 senators.
  - The House of Representatives is the lower house. They are also considered the people's house, as they are elected by the people of separate, even electorates. There are 151 house of reps.
### The High Court
#### Roles and Powers
The high court was formed in 1903.  
The roles of the high court is to hear to civil and criminal matter and other matters  
- Determining appeals
- Interpreting the Constitution
- Other areas (like state v state, state v commonwealth)
#### Appellate and Original Jurisdiction
The high court hears appeals from lower courts (mainly supreme court)  
Original Jurisdiction is where matters are heard for the first time.  
- Generally this happens in lower courts, then is appealed higher and higher
#### Court Hierarchy of WA
Made of different courts  
They are ranked by the seriousness of matters they hear to - the higher the court, the more serious the matter  
- Magistrates court -> District court -> Supreme Court of Western Australia -> High Court of Australia.  
- They all attend to civil and criminal matters, but only the High Court of Australia deals with things outside of this.  
#### Dual Citizeship

- Both Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms had their visas cancelled due to criminal matters.

- Love and Thoms were men of Indigenous tribes
- They were facing deportation until section 501 of the migration act
- The decision was handed down in 11th of Feb 2020
