## Test Notes - Myanmar
#### Legitimacy
###### Upheld
Largely free vote until 2020

- Military respected the results

Predictable pattern until 2020

	- Not in public office

###### Undermined
Equal vote
- 25% of seats go to military
- Powerful cabinet positions go to military (home affairs, defence, border affairs)
- Aung San Suu Kyi is blocked from being government - constitution blocks people who have immediate foreign family to be president
- Voting has been cancelled in 7 townships and partially in 30 others
	- However, can be justified as those townships were in war

Right to stand for office

	- Denying parents were citizens
- No Muslims in NLD or USDP

Free electorate
- Rohingya people who hold "white cards" are not allowed to vote

Military Coup
- 2021 coup - undermined legitimacy and political system
- Democratically elected parliament of Myanmar was replaced by unelected military leader

#### Justice
