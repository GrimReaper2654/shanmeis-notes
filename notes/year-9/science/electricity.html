    <h2>Notes on Electricity</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h4>Coulomb's Law</h4>
    <p>Coulomb's law is that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. They have the same overall charge. Protons and electons attract, while their same kind repel. They have an attraction rate, and electrons can move around because of this. In shells, protons and electrons attract each other, and that's what keeps the atom together.

    <h4>Coulombs (measurement)</h4>
    <p>A coulomb is a measure of electrical force. It requires <var>6.24*10^18</var> protons or electrons to equal a coulomb.</p>
    <h4>Ionisation</h4>
    <p>The act of becoming an ion.</p>
