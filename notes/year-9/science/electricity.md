  <h2>Notes on Electricity</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <h4>Coulomb's Law</h4>
  <p>Coulomb's law is that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. They have the same overall charge. Protons and electons attract, while their same kind repel. They have an attraction rate, and electrons can move around because of this. In shells, protons and electrons attract each other, and that's what keeps the atom together.

  <h4>Coulombs (measurement)</h4>
  <p>A coulomb is a measure of electrical force. It requires <var>6.24*10^18</var> protons or electrons to equal a coulomb.</p>
  <h4>Ionisation</h4>
  <p>The act of becoming an ion.</p>
  <h3>Static Electricity</h3>
  <h4>Insulators</h4>
  <p>Insulators are materials that don't conduct electricity well. I will expand on this later.</p>
  <h4>Static Charge and Discharge</h4>
  <p>The theory of static electricity has been written for over 2000 years. These deal with insulators. <br>When two things rub against each other, they both become charged (one positive, one negative). When they are rubbed, they transfer and lose electrons. This is because of the pull from the protons - the object with higher positive charge will attract electrons and the one with weaker positive charge will get the electrons ripped from them. Literally like an irl relationship. When you slap the charged object onto something else that is oppositely charged, it will stick to it. That's why hair and balloon stick when you rub them. Eventually, the extra charge will disperse and the material will either gain back its electrons or transfer their electrons to air. This process is called static discharge.</p>
  <h4>Grounding</h4>
  <p>Literally connect a non-reactice object to the ground. Preferably earth, carpet will probably not work. If you don't ground and the static charge keeps building and building there will be a spark created. I literally screamed when I put the metal ball at the Vann de Graaf.</p>
  <h3>Circuits</h3>
