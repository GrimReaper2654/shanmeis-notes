  <h2>Notes on Electricity</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <h4>Coulomb's Law</h4>
  <p>Coulomb's law is that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. They have the same overall charge. Protons and electons attract, while their same kind repel. They have an attraction rate, and electrons can move around because of this. In shells, protons and electrons attract each other, and that's what keeps the atom together. 
  </p>
  <h4>Coulombs (measurement)</h4>
  <p>A coulomb is a measure of electrical force. It requires <var>6.24*10^18</var> protons or electrons to equal a coulomb.</p>
  <h4>Ionisation</h4>
  <p>The act of becoming an ion.</p>
  <h3>Static Electricity</h3>
  <h4>Insulators</h4>
  <p>Insulators are materials that don't conduct electricity well. I will expand on this later.</p>
  <h4>Static Charge and Discharge</h4>
  <p>The theory of static electricity has been written for over 2000 years. These deal with insulators. <br>When two things rub against each other, they both become charged (one positive, one negative). When they are rubbed, they transfer and lose electrons. This is because of the pull from the protons - the object with higher positive charge will attract electrons and the one with weaker positive charge will get the electrons ripped from them. Literally like an irl relationship. When you slap the charged object onto something else that is oppositely charged, it will stick to it. That's why hair and balloon stick when you rub them. This charge is created by kinetic energy. Eventually, the extra charge will disperse and the material will either gain back its electrons or transfer their electrons to air. This process is called static discharge.</p>
  <h4>Lightning</h4>
  <p>Lightning is based off static charge and kinetic energy. When water molecules bump in the sky, they will charge each other. Within the cloud, the positive charges will float to the top and the negative to the bottom of the cloud. And when there is enough kinetic energy a very large spark will be created.
  <h4>Grounding</h4>
  <p>Literally connect a non-reactice object to the ground. Preferably earth, carpet will probably not work. If you don't ground and the static charge keeps building and building there will be a spark created. I literally screamed when I put the metal ball at the Vann de Graaf.</p>
  <h3>Circuits</h3>
  <h4>Batteries</h4>

But very funny looking. Some stuff isn't aligned. Stupid thing...<br>Aside from that, one side of the battery is negatively charged, one side is positively charged. The negatively charged half is full of electrons. The positively charged side is full of protons that don't have electrons attached to them. They really want the electrons in the other half. This is called potential diffence. A classmate pointed out this was just like two lovers yearning for each other (there's this classmate where the relationships analogies are coming from). However, when the two sides of the battery are insulated from one another, the reaction cannot occur. When a wire is wired between them, the reaction occurs, and when all the electrons are with the protons, the reaction is finished, and the battery is "flat." <br>The potential difference is called voltage (V).<br>1 coulomb per second is an Amp (A).</p>
  <h4>Circuits</h4>
  <p>When there is a gap in circuitry, there needs a large potential difference for the electrons to make the jump.</p>
  <h4>Old theories</h4>
  <p>Convential current ≠ normal current. Convential current was the theory that positive charges flowed to the negative charges.<p>
  <h4>Resistance<h4>
