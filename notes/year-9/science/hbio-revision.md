## Year 9 Human Bio Revision
#### Year 7/8 Bio Recap
**M**ovement -> moving  
**R**espiration -> Chemical reaction cells use to trasform energy into glucose and oxygen or water and carbon  
**S**ensitivity -> Receiving + processing + responding to external stimuli  
**G**rowth  
**R**eproduction -> Mitosis, Miosis and Binoeffician  
- Mitosis and BF create identical clones - asexual reproduction
- Miosis is mixing of DNA - sexual reproduction

**E**xcretion -> removal of waste created by the body (that has been used by the body)  
**N**utrition

#### Homeostasis
Maintenance of an optimal internal environment
- Lots of effort
- Ideal range is called narrow range or set point - where body functions best
	- Temperature, oxygen, glucose and salt levels

Importance of homeostasis (hs)
- Enzyme activity
	- Enable enzyme related reactions
- Cell size
	- Temperature fluctuation can change water levels in cell
- Independence from external conditions
	- Animals with constant internal environment can maintain constant activity regardless of environment

#### Osmosis and Diffusion
See [Osmosis and Diffusion](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes/year-9/science/osmosis-diffusion.html)

#### Excretory System
Excretion
- Removal of wastes produced by metabolism with cells
	- Glucose + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water

Elimination
- Removal of undigested materials like faeces

Examples of excretion
- Lungs remove carbon dioxide + water
- Sweat glands remove water, salts and urea
- Kidneys remove water, salt and urea

Types of metabolic waste
- Digestive wastes
	- Bile (bilirubin)
		- Wate product of red blood cells
		- If not excreted, can lead to jaundice
- Respiratory
	- Carbon dioxide
		- By-product of cellular respiration
		- Too much can lead to hypercapnia -> shortness of breath, fatigue, blood become acidic -> respiratory acidosis
- Excess water and salts
	- Water
		- Required to dissolve and move molecules and ions in body
		- Too much can lead to hypotonic solutions -> bursting cells :(
	- Sodium
		- Conducts nerve impulses
		- Too much can lead to hypertonic solutions -> shrivelling cells :( and kidney stones
	- Potassium
- Nitrogenous waste
	- Ammonia, urea, uric acid

Organ functions
- Kidneys
	- Filter blood to remove nitrogenous and water wastes and produces urine
- Ureters
	- Transports urine from kidney to bladder
- Bladder
	- Urine storage
	- "Squeezes" to remove urine
- Urethra
	- Transport urine from bladder to the urinary opening
- Urinary opening
	- Part of urethra, where urine exits body.

Anatomy:

Kidney:
<img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/kidney.jpeg" class="osmosis">
- The two kidneys receive 1100 - 2000L of water every day
- We have 5.6L of blood so 600mL of liquid goes through each kidney every minute
- Around 99% of filtrate is reabsorbed
- There is around 1 million nephrons every kidney
	- Located between cortex and medulla

Nepron
<img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/nephron.jpeg" class="osmosis">

1. Blood enters glomerulus
2. All protein based things (cells) don't transfer to Bowman's capsule. Everything else is called filtrate
3. Filtrate goes through proximal convuluted tubule, useful things are reabsorbed into blood
4. Loop of Henle absorbs water. If blood dehydrated, will absorb less water, vice versa
5. Tubular secretion adds substances to the filtrate, as blood needs to retain certain pH (7.4 - 7.5)
	- Adds things like hydrogen and ammonium. Happens at distal convulated tubule
6. Filtrate goes to collecting duct and is now urine

Bladder
- Holds max of 750mL of liquid
- Held by sphincter. Released to release urine

Animals have different nephrons
- Desert animals can have longer/more loop of Henles to reabsorb more water

Composition
- 500mL of water needs to be filtered out to remove metabolic wastes
- Healthy urine is 96% water
	- Yellow pigment comes from bile and vitamin B
- Protein in urine can cause kidney disease
- Glucose in urine can indicate diabetes

Dialysis
- Putting blood through artificial kidney
- Veins in arm are connected to a tube and blood goes through a machine

#### Nervous System
The neuron
<img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/motor-neuron.jpeg" class="osmosis">
- Neuron has all the cell organelles
- Dendrites collect information from outside
- Information collected at cell body
- Electrical signals go down axon
- Axon terminal is "connected" to other dendrites
	- Gap between terminal and next dendrite called synapse
	- Axon terminal sends neurotransmitter (nt) through a chemical-electrical process
- Schwann cells are attached to the axon and insulates axon
	- Faster electrical current

Synapse
- Where neurons meet
- A gap where electrical signals cannot pass
	- Activates synaptic  vessicles which have nt. They are released and they diffuse through gap
		- Going down concentration gradient
	- All-or-nothing event
- Electric impulse = action potential
- Nt will attach to dendrite receptors
	- Can travel up to 50km/h

Steps
- Sensory input - Monitor stimuli from outside of body
- Integrating - interprets sensory input
- Motor output - response to stimuli - activates effector organs

Nervous systems
- Central
	- Made of brain and spine
	- Receives info from body and sends back
- Peripheral
	- Made of everything else
	- Receives and acts on stimuli

#### Interactions between systems
Nervous and endocrine systems provide internal communication between cells and coordination of system
- Nervous
	- Nerve cells
	- Impulses
	- Sending signals from brain -> body
	- Signal type = Electrical-chemical (action potential/nt)
	- Speed of signal = Reaches in milliseconds
	- Duration = Short
- Endocrine
	- Glands secrete hormones into bloodstream
	- Picked up by target hormone
	- Target responds to hormone
	- Signal type = chemical (hormones)
	- Speed = relatively slow, travels in blood
	- Duration = long-lasting

#### Endocrine system
Protein receptors
<img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/protien-receptor.jpeg" class="osmosis">
- Hormones attach to the protein receptors that don't allow things through

Functions
- Hypothalamus
	- Base of brain
	- Functions include homeostasis + more
	- Links endocrine system to pituitary gland and CNS
	- Not a gland, are nt
- Pituitary gland
	- Below hypothalamus
	- Master gland
	- Produces many hormones
- Thyroid gland
	- Front of neck
	- Metabolic waste
- Parathyroid gland
	- Back of thyroid gland
	- Controls blood calcium levels
- Adrenal gland
	- Top of kidney
	- Produces many hormones including adrenaline/epinephrine and cortisol
	- Fight and flight response
	- Increases energy levels
	- Increase metabolism, breathing and heart rate
- Pancreas
	- Middle of kidneys
	- Releases insulin
		- Glucose -> glycogen
	- Releases glucagon
		- Glycogen -> glucose
	- These two cannot happen at same time because of nervous system's sympathetic response
- Ovaries
	- Produces oestrogen and progesterone
	- Controls menstrual cycle
- Testes
	- Produces testosterone
	- Male characteristics

Negative feedback
- Hormones regulated by negative feedback
	- ADH (Antidiuretic hormone) when blood plasma concentration is high
	- ADH tells kidneys to absorb more water

Response to exercise
- Needs energy - cellular respiration. Glucose
- Exercise decreases blood glucose -> pancreas
- Sweat -> water balance -> ADH
- Pituitary gland releases endorphins
