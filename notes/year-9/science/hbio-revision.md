## Year 9 Human Bio Revision
#### Year 7/8 Bio Recap
**M**ovement -> moving  
**R**espiration -> Chemical reaction cells use to trasform energy into glucose and oxygen or water and carbon  
**S**ensitivity -> Receiving + processing + responding to external stimuli  
**G**rowth  
**R**eproduction -> Mitosis, Miosis and Binoeffician  
- Mitosis and BF create identical clones - asexual reproduction
- Miosis is mixing of DNA - sexual reproduction

**E**xcretion -> removal of waste created by the body (that has been used by the body)  
**N**utrition

#### Homeostasis
Maintenance of an optimal internal environment
- Lots of effort
- Ideal range is called narrow range or set point - where body functions best
	- Temperature, oxygen, glucose and salt levels

Importance of homeostasis (hs)
- Enzyme activity
	- Enable enzyme related reactions
- Cell size
	- Temperature fluctuation can change water levels in cell
- Independence from external conditions
	- Animals with constant internal environment can maintain constant activity regardless of environment

#### Osmosis and Diffusion
See [Osmosis and Diffusion](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/notes/year-9/science/osmosis-diffusion.html)

#### Excretory System
Excretion
- Removal of wastes produced by metabolism with cells
	- Glucose + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water

Elimination
- Removal of undigested materials like faeces

Examples of excretion
- Lungs remove carbon dioxide + water
- Sweat glands remove water, salts and urea
- Kidneys remove water, salt and urea

Types of metabolic waste
- Digestive wastes
	- Bile (bilirubin)
		- Wate product of red blood cells
		- If not excreted, can lead to jaundice
- Respiratory
	- Carbon dioxide
		- By-product of cellular respiration
		- Too much can lead to hypercapnia -> shortness of breath, fatigue, blood become acidic -> respiratory acidosis
- Excess water and salts
	- Water
		- Required to dissolve and move molecules and ions in body
		- Too much can lead to hypotonic solutions -> bursting cells :(
	- Sodium
		- Conducts nerve impulses
		- Too much can lead to hypertonic solutions -> shrivelling cells :( and kidney stones
	- Potassium
- Nitrogenous waste
	- Ammonia, urea, uric acid

Organ functions
- Kidneys
	- Filter blood to remove nitrogenous and water wastes and produces urine
- Ureters
	- Transports urine from kidney to bladder
- Bladder
	- Urine storage
	- "Squeezes" to remove urine
- Urethra
	- Transport urine from bladder to the urinary opening
- Urinary opening
	- Part of urethra, where urine exits body.

Kidney:
<img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/kidney.jpeg" class="osmosis">
- The two kidneys receive 1100 - 2000L of water every day
- We have 5.6L of blood so 600mL of liquid goes through each kidney every minute
- Around 99% of filtrate is reabsorbed
- There is around 1 million nephrons every kidney
	- Located between cortex and medulla

Nepron
<img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/nephron.jpeg" class="osmosis">

1. Blood enters glomerulus
2. All protein based things (cells) don't transfer to Bowman's capsule. Everything else is called filtrate
3. Filtrate goes through proximal convuluted tubule, useful things are reabsorbed into blood
4. Loop of Henle absorbs water. If blood dehydrated, will absorb less water, vice versa
5. Tubular secretion adds substances to the filtrate, as blood needs to retain certain pH (7.4 - 7.5)
	- Adds things like hydrogen and ammonium. Happens at distal convulated tubule
6. Filtrate goes to collecting duct and is now urine

Bladder
- Holds max of 750mL of liquid
- Held by sphincter. Released to release urine

Animals have different nephrons
- Desert animals can have longer/more loop of Henles to reabsorb more water

Composition
- 500mL of water needs to be filtered out to remove metabolic wastes
- Healthy urine is 96% water
	- Yellow pigment comes from bile and vitamin B
- Protein in urine can cause kidney disease
- Glucose in urine can indicate diabetes

Dialysis
- Putting blood through artificial kidney
- Veins in arm are connected to a tube and blood goes through a machine
