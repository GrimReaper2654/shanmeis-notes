## Osmosis and Diffusion
#### Cell Requirements
Cells require relatively stable environments.  
- Some cells are more suscpetible to change than others (like brain cells in relation to skin cells)
- Balance of glucose, oxygen and temperature
#### Cell Membrane Structure
Terminology include Phobic- and Phillic-.  
- Phobic means adversion of
- Phillic means attraction to
- Hydrophobic and hydrophillic
The cell membrane is made of the phospholipid bilayer.  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/phospholipid-bilayar-1.jpeg"></div>
Things have hydrophillic if they have a polar charge  
- Water has a slight charge (the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the hydrogens have a slight positive charge.)
Things are hydrophobic if they have no charge.

Cell membranes are differencially permeable  
- Let some things pass through the membrane
  - Generally based on size.
  - Also called selectively or semi-permeable
#### Passive v Active Processes
Passive uses no energy  
- Dead cells can do
- Virtually unpreventable
Active processes use energy  
- Only living cells can do
#### Concentrations and gradients
Concentration  
- When sucrose is dissolved it water:
  - Sucrose = solute
  - Water = solvent
- The more solute there is, the more concentrated it is
Gradient  
- When going from high -> low concentration gradient is called going down the concentration gradient
- When going from low -> high concentration gradient it is called going against the concentration gradient.
  - This requires energy
#### Diffusion
Diffusion is when molecules diffuse through the cell membrane  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/diffusion.jpeg"></div>

- After fully diffusing, there is still diffusion (due to kinetic energy) but there is no net change in particles
#### Osmosis
Osmosis is a special kind of diffusion in cell membranes which involves diffusion of water.  
- High -> low concentration of water
- Cell's surface
#### Water Potential
Water potential is how likely water is able to move.  
- Proportional to concentration
- Related to measure of how much water compared to how much solute  
Î¨ symbol  
Measured in kiloPascals (kPa).  
Pure water has highest water potential  
- Value of 0kPa  
Solutions have lower water potential  
- Negative kPa  
Water potential is how we determine net movement of water by osmosis.  
#### Hypertonic
More concentration of solute (than another solution)  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/hypertonic.jpeg"></div>

  - More water coming out than into the cell
  - Cell is shrivelled on the inside :(
  - Net movement of water out of the cell
  - Hypertonic to solution outside of cell
#### Isotonic
Has same concentration of solutes  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/isotonic.jpeg"></div>

  - Equal rate of H~2~O going in and out of cell
  - No net movement of solute
  - Isotonic to rest of solution outside of cell
  - Healthy cell
#### Hypotonic
Lower concentration of solute  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/hypotonic.jpeg"></div>

  - More water going into cell than out of cell
  - Cell wall has expenaded and under lots of strain and pressure, and could explode
  - Net movement of water into the cell
  - Hypotonic to the outside of the cell
#### Simple diffusion  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/simple-diffusion.jpeg"></div>

  - What happens for particles that are big enough to fit through the protein carrier
  - You can't choose what can go through the cell - anything of the size
#### Facilitated diffusion  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/facilitated-diffusion.jpeg"></div>

  - What happens for slighty bigger particles
  - Carrier protein changes shape to allow substance into cell
  - Facilitated diffusion can pick and choose what can go through
#### Active Transport  
<div class="osmosis"><img src="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/assets/science/active-transport.jpeg"></div>

  - ATP is required
    - Made from mitochondria :D
  - From low concentration -> high concentration
  - Pulls substance into cell
#### Cytosis
Cytosis is where materials move into or out of the cell enclosed by vessicles
- Vessicles are bubble like structures consisting of a solit particle or liquid droplet enfolded in cell membrane
  - For substances too big to fit through membrane
  - Vessicles come from golgi complex
    - Golgi complex wraps up these things
- Uses energy
- Two terms:
  - Endocytosis - going into the cell
  - Exocytosis - going out of the cell
- Also called vesicular transport
