  <h2>Year 9 Term 1 Cat Task</h2>
  <h3>Researching and Planning</h3>
  <h4>Hypothesis</h4>If the voltage across an ohmic resistor increases, the current and voltage will proportianally to each other, while if the voltage across a non-ohmic resistor increases, the current and voltage will not increase proportionally to each other.
  <h4>Variables</h4>
  <p>Independant Variable: Voltage of the power supply across ohmic and non-ohmic resistors (V)<br>Dependant variable: The proportionality between current and voltage.<br>Controlled Variables: The resistance of the wires (Ohms), the material of the wire, the length of wires used (m).</p>
  <h4>Research</h4>
  <h5>1. What is Ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Ohmic resistance is the sum of the resistors, resistance of the current collector, the active mass and the resistance of the wires. Basically, It is the resistance of every part of the circuit combined.</p>
  <h5>2. What is non-Ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Non-Ohmic resistance is resistance that doesn't follow Ohm's law (V = I/R), such as temperature.</p>
  <h5>3. How can we tell if a material has ohmic or non-ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>ERm<br>When the current and voltage is graphed, the lines are not straight and are not proportianate to one another.</p>
  <h5>4. What is the difference between ohmic resistance and non-ohmic resistance?
  <p>Ohmic resistance follows Ohm's law (V = IR), whereas non-Ohmic resistance does not.</p>
  <h5>5. How is the graphing of voltage vs current used to determine ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>When you graph ohmic current and voltage, they will move in similar motion. If one goes diagonally down, the other will also go diagonally down, and vice versa. However, when you graph non-ohmic resistance, the direction and gradiant of the lines will fluctuate.</p>
  <h5>6. List and explain the types of devices which display non ohmic behaviour</h5>
  <p>Filament lamp. The hotter the lamp gets, the more resistance it will gain. This doesn't follow Ohm's law, therefore it is non-ohmic.<br>Diode. Diodes only allow a one-way flow of electrons, and if flown the other way round, electrons are not able to pass. This doesn't follow Ohm's law.<br>Thermistor. The resistance decreases as the temperature increases.<br>Light dependant resistors. The resistance of these decrease as the amount of light shone on them decrease.</p>
  <h4>Method and the rest of the stuff</h4>
  <p>Looks like you have come to what I am willing to share. Since this is still when the assessment is active, I will post my finished report when it is past the due date for the assessment. Just a reminder, this website isn't for me to give you all the answers, but for you to learn things. If you would still like to see my report for reference, contact me.</p>
