#### Poem
_Allegro_  
Springtime is upon us.  
The birds celebrate her return with festive song,  
and murmuring streams are  
softly caressed by the breezes.  
Thunderstorms, those heralds of Spring, roar,  
casting their dark mantle over heaven,  
Then they die away to silence,  
and the birds take up their charming songs once more.  
  
_Largo_  
On the flower-strewn meadow, with leafy branches  
rustling overhead, the goat-herd sleeps,  
his faithful dog beside him.  
  
_Allegro_  
Led by the festive sound of rustic bagpipes,  
nymphs and shepherds lightly dance  
beneath spring's beautiful canopy.
