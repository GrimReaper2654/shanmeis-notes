## Concert Prac Speech Term 2
Hello everyone  
Today I'll be playing Prelude from Suite Bergamasque, written by Claude Debussy. He is a french composer of the impressionist period. He was most well known for writing La Mer. The Suite Bergamasque was one of his early works - written in 1890 and revised and publish in 1905.  
Hope you enjoy.
