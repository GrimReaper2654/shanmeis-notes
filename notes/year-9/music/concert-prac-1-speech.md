## Concert Prac Speech Term 2
Hello everyone  
Today I'll be playing Prelude from Suite Bergamasque, written by Claude Debussy. He is a french composer of the impressionist period. He was most well known for writing La Mer. The Suite Bergamasque was one of his early works - written in 1890 and revised and publish in 1905.  
Hope you enjoy.

### Reflection and Results
#### Reflection
I messed up pretty badly. The first runs were fairly questionable. There were a bunch of wrote notes everywhere and I even lost where I was at one point. However, I dont' think I messed up badly enough to receive below 90.
#### Results
Well... I did alright I guess. 92%. He questioned my scaling passages.
