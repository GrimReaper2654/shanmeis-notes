1.  Laws and social attitudes towards money lending during Shakespeare's time  
	-   To the early Elizabethans, the practice of borrowing money under controlled conditions was still offensive
	-   Perhaps the most widespread stereotype of Jews that survived in Shakespeare's time related to usury, the practice of lending money at interest.
	-   Both Christian and Jewish law did not approve of money lending at interest, which was called 'usury'
	-   Jewish law forbade usury among Jews, it did not do so between Jews and Christians
	-   Jews made a lot of money as they lend money but with interest
	-   Usury was regarded as unproductive-as the taking of something for nothing
	-   Christian prohibited for lending loans

2.  The treatment of Jews across Europe during the Renaissance era
	- Treatment towards Jewish people were negative during this period
	- Jews were often tried to be converted to Christianity by officials.
	- Many stories were written of Jewish criminality, such as killing.
	- They were mostly bullied by the Christian people for being Jewish, and they were highly dislike by everyone
	- They were sometimes punished for being Jewish, with punishments like death sentence
	- Jewish people who were suspected of being Jewish would be questioned, and if they were found to be Jewish, they would be burned to death
	- Jewish people were often sent away from England during that time
	- Jewish people (and Protestants) were treated as heretics
	- Considered to be aliens

3.  Trading networks in Venice during the 16th century
	- There were then basically two main trade routes:
	- Northern route, connecting Venice to Morea Constantinople and the Black Sea, up to Azov and the Crimea 
	- Southern route, via Candia to Alessandria in Egypt or via Cyprus to the Syrian-Palestinian coastline (Alexandretta, Latachia, Beirut, Acre and Jaffa) 
	- Venice traded gems, mineral dyes, peacock feathers, spices, and a profusion of textiles such as silks, cottons and brocades from Egypt, Asia Minor and the Far East all passed through the ports of Venice, and were taken on by Venetian merchants to Europe, where they were becoming highly desirable and valuable items 
	- Throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Venetian and Ottoman empires were trading partners—a mutually beneficial relationship providing each with access to key ports and valuable goods 

4.  Attitudes towards marriage and courtship during the Renaissance era 
	- A couple wishing to marry had first to obtain the blessing of the church, either by obtaining a licence to marry, or by having the ‘banns’ read – that is, announcing the couple’s names and their intent to marry 
	- Marriages were often arranged, and focused on kinship bonds and a rearrangement of property 
	- The woman had very little, if any, choice in who her husband might be 
	- Europeans saw love and marriage as two important, but very different, parts of life 
	- Poets described love as an overpowering force, both spiritual and sexual. For most people, however, marriage was a more practical matter. 
	- Elizabethans also thought that real love was important in a good marriage, too. To give real love time to grow, a period of courtship was usual before the relationship became serious.   
	- It was only in the 16th century that the church decreed that wedding be performed in public, by a priest, and before witnesses.   
	- Marriage was an excuse for men to achieve a higher status in wealth and for women to obtain a partner to bear children with 
	- Any marriage not made public beforehand was considered illegal 
	- It was considered inappropriate to have sexual relations outside of marriage 

5.  The role of women in society during the time period the play was set 
	- Men were valued more than women 
	- While men held almost absolute authority, married women had virtually no rights as citizens 
	- Mothers had no legal rights over the guardianship of their children and any property that a woman possessed at the time of marriage came under the husband's control. 
	- Women were expected to be subservient, quiet and homebound, with their primary ambitions entirely confined to marriage, childbirth and homemaking 
	- women belonged to their fathers (or their brothers if their father died), and then to their husbands 
	- Women could not own property of their own 
	- They were instructed and expected to become devoted mothers, and to rear and raise their children as proper Christians 
	- A very common job for women in the 16th century was a domestic servant. Other women were midwives 

6.  How did religion impact society during the time the play was written? 
	- Most of Shakespeare’s plays were influenced by Christians and their culture. Jewish people were shown to be the corrupt or evil characters, while Christians were the main characters who shown to be good.  

7. How were legal disputes handled during the 16th century? 
	- Theft and violence were the most common criminal acts in 16th century England. People who were caught in the act of such things were judged at courts. 
	- During the Elizabethan era, the judiciary had slowly began to become separate from government (Elizabeth I excluded judges from her Privy Court). 
	- Local quarter sessions:
		- Local courts that did not judge particularly serious crimes. 
	- Assize courts 
		- Apart from higher courts in London, England and Wales were divided into geographical areas where assize courts, or periodic courts, were available. Those courts were presided over by visiting judges from higher courts based in London. 
		- The system of judges based in London travelling around the country, was called the assize system, and ended in 1971. 
		- These courts usually judged matters that were too serious for the local quarter sessions. 
	- Punishment 
		- During Tudor and Stuart era, capital punishment was used for serious crimes. The most common kind of execution was by hanging, usually for crimes like theft, etc.  Additionally, England was very prejudiced towards acts of heresy, and often had people burnt at the stake. 
		- For the crime of treason, the method of execution was beheading, or hanging, drawing, and quartering. Royalty was beheaded, usually with an axe. However, the execution hanging, drawing and quartering was extremely brutal. 
		- The full method goes like this: 
			1. First, the doomed is tied to a horse and dragged to the gallows. 
			2. Then, they are hanged but not to the point of death. 
			3. The rest of the steps usually included live disembowelment, beheading, burning of the entrails, and tying the four limbs to different horses and then pulling the body apart. 
			4. The body was then either cut into four or beheaded 
		- This punishment was reserved for high treason (like attempting to assassinate the king, etc.) 
		- Society in England strongly believed in the act of retribution. Acts of punishment for offenders were so extreme so as to inflict ‘punishment and retribution’ for their deeds. 
		- The method of naming and shaming was quite common, some crimes allowed for the offenders to be carted around with a placard describing their offense. 
		- A famous punishment was the offender being forced to put their head and hands in a wooden plank. This was called the pillory: and the public could harm the offender as they wished. 
		- Criminal offences were dealt with quickly and brutally; however, the prisons were still crowded. They were crowded and full of disease. However, people put in prisons were ones who had breached the civil law, such as debtors. 
	- Court of Chancery 
		- It served to address the problems of the judiciary system (common law) and was presided by the Lord Chancellor. At the court, people could petition to have their case heard again if they felt the common law had failed them. However, eventually, the Lord Chancellor held too much power and could determine cases based on his liking, making it hard for lawyers to argue a case.
