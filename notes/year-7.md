  <h2>Year 7 Notes</h2>
  <h4>Reflection of Year 7</h4>
  <p>Year 7 for me was quite an eventful year. The year started with our settling in - we would start the year very timid and afraid of what we were meant to do, surrounded by all the scary year 8s and the frighteningly tall year 12s. Many of us also still retained the personalities of our primary school selves - we were kind, some a little sassy and some a little shy.<br>We started the term off with a focus day - getting used to computers, doing some mindfulness activities (which many of us did not enjoy, but please, I found it quite fun) and getting to know each other better. We also had Mufti day, our first whole school social event. Many of us bought many things and sat in desolate corners with our short, year 7 friends as year 9s eyed us suspiciously.<b>Term 2 was a little more eventful than the first, with lightning carnival and our year group camp. Many people also started owning their teenage personalities - grumpier, sassier and meaner than our primary school selves. And the rolled up skirt trend spread across at least half of the year 7 girls. Year 7 lightning carnival was joint with our year 7 camp. Year 7 lightning carnival had 4 sports to choose from - soccer (which I chose), basketball, cricket and afl, I believe. I am not that sure of the other 3 sports but that's what I think they were. After the lightning carnival, we headed straight for year 7 camp at Woodman point. There were multiple activities, like orienteering, archery, rock climbing and beach activities. Each person only got to do half of the activities, but they were all extremely fun. Year 7 camp is a good opportunity to push yourself and get to know other people better.<br>Term 3 was quite bland. Not much happened, just more stress.<br>Term 4 was quite nice. We ended with a river cruise and many of us met new friends on the cruise. It was a very fun experience, we got to see each other in a little more formal clothing. The end of the year was also when half of the cohort realised "oh yipee I don't have to do compulsory choir anymore!" We also had the locker rush, and the transition from stokes to andrews.</p>
  <h4>Thoughts on the Curriculum</h4>
  <p>It wasn't exactly the greatest year for studying for me, had a lot of procrastination habits throughout year 7. Was definitely a learning curve for me habits wise. However, the curriculum wasn't the best, but it held its own and had it's ups and downs.<br>English was ok, you learnt many basics and fundamentals for essay writing. Not very much done on the creative side like narratives and persuasive though. Some tasks I feel were quite redundant and not very "English-subject" based, such as the movie poster task in term 2 (I didn't ever end up getting my mark and feedback for that) and the making a documentary task that was never assessed. I had Miss Donaldson, she's a pretty good teacher and her classes were mostly fun and helpful. Very open to questions as well.<br>Math was quite "eh," just my teacher wasn't very good. Didn't learn a lot of stuff because all he gave was mathspace tasks and didn't really teach - it's like a what perth mod actually is - a school for self learning. Teacher was still quite open to questions but didn't always give explanations the best...<br>Science was quite good, especially first term where we learned science inquiry skills - I have attached my booklet in the science inquiryÂ section. Earth and space science was full of theory, boring but useful if you want to pursue space sciences. I find that the information however wasn't repeated in year 8 and wasn't helpful to me. Biology was pretty redundant to what I learned in primary school, like plant structures, etc. Chemistry... what we learnt gets repeated in year 8 I think... not good use of the term in my opinion. I don't remember doing physics, information didn't get retained in year 8. I got a Japanese teacher, but she was very knowledgable about science, answered the answerable questions (not the intellectual ones) and everyone score pretty high on the test (I think I topped the class once in one test ;) )<br>
